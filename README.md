# Dracula.swift

A partial port of the 
[Graph Dracula JavaScript Graph Library](https://www.graphdracula.net) to Swift.

Mostly a naive port, but seem to work well enough for my purposes.
Doesn't include a renderer.


## Dracula.js

[Dracula.js](https://www.graphdracula.net)
is a set of tools to display and layout interactive connected graphs and 
networks, along with various related algorithms from the field of 
[graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory).
